# Rounded Corners

This app rounds the corners of your Windows screen.

![Rounded Corners](./.github/cover.png)

## Getting started

Rounded Corners sets up a system tray application using the Tauri framework. It
creates a window for each monitor available on the system, sets up a menu for
the system tray, and handles events from the menu.

## Code

The code imports several crates:

-   `regex`
-   `serde_json`
-   `tauri`
-   `tauri_plugin_store`

`regex` provides support for regular expressions, `serde_json` is a JSON
serialization/deserialization library, `tauri` is the main framework for
building cross-platform desktop apps in Rust, and `tauri_plugin_store` provides
a key-value store for persisting application data.

## Options

The app has several menu items:

-   **Increase Size**
-   **Decrease Size**
-   **Reset**
-   **Dark**
-   **Light**
-   **Show**
-   **Hide**
-   **Exit**

Clicking on **Increase Size** or **Decrease Size** increases or decreases the
roundness of the windows, respectively.

**Reset** sets the corner radius back to the default value of _23px_.

**Dark** and **Light** switch the app between dark and light mode. **Show** and
**Hide** show or hide all windows, respectively.

**Exit** closes the app.
